    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : str
        Filename to use.
    return_offsets : bool
        If True, return the time of each press relative to trial onset
        in addition to the press number.

    Returns
    -------
    events : array
        Array of events of shape (N, 3), re-coded such that 1 triggers
        are renamed according to their binary expyfun representation.
    presses : list of ndarray
        List of all press events that occurred between each one
        trigger. Each array has shape (N_presses,). If return_offset is True,
        then each array has shape (N_presses, 2), with the first column
        as the time offset from the trial trigger.
    orig_events : array
        Original events array.

    Notes
    -----
    When this function translates binary event codes into decimal integers, it
    adds 1 to the value of all events. This is done to prevent the occurrence
    of events with a value of 0 (which downstream processing would treat as
    non-events). If you need to convert the integer event codes back to binary,
    subtract 1 before doing so to yield the original binary values.
