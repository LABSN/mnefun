Overview
========

``mnefun`` is designed to streamline ILABS data processing by automating and
standardizing data retrieval, remote machine processing (MaxFilter),
preprocessing steps, and inverse computation.

A critical idea is that, once an experiment is complete, **you or another ILABS
person should be able to run your analysis script once, from scratch, for all
subjects**, and end up with all of the basic preprocessed files (evoked,
epochs, inverse, etc.) you will need for your downstream scripts used for
publication (stats, etc.).

To achieve ``mnefun``'s reproducibility goal, **it is important
not to run your processing script by changing parameters for different
subjects as you process each of them, or by doing steps manually**.
Where subject-specific values are needed, we can add functionality to allow
subject-specific values in the script itself, such as ``proj_nums``
(see below).

.. note::

    The one step that might (somewhat routinely) need to be "worked around" is
    the data fetching step, which requires that the files on the acquisition
    machine be named properly, which might not always be the case, for example
    when:

    - files are named incorrectly (typos, inconsistently) during acquisition
    - runs are re-executed and saved with a different name
      (e.g., ``_redo_raw.fif``).

    But this should ideally be the exception and not the rule.

Experiment parameters can be specified using a ``params = Params(...)`` call in
a script (old way), or by specifying a YAML script with the experiment
parameters (new way) and using :func:`mnefun.read_params` to load the
parameters. The processing pipeline steps and relationships are given below.
All YAML parameters are described in their appropriate sections.
Consider looking at ``mnefun/examples/funloc`` directory for a canonical
example of how to process data using mnefun.

.. graphviz:: _static/flow.dot

Running parameters
------------------

``general``: General options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
work_dir : str
    Working directory, usually ".".
subjects_dir : str
    Directory containing the structurals.
subject_indices : list
    Which subjects to process.
disp_files : bool
    Display status.

.. note:: Anywhere a ``dict`` is supported as an option (e.g.,
          ``mf_prebad`` or ``proj_nums``), a special entry ``'__default__'``
          can be used turn the dictionary into a
          :class:`~python:collections.defaultdict` instance.
          This is useful in cases where a single set of values works for most
          subjects, but a few need different ones. For example in YAML form:

          .. code-block:: YAML

              proj_nums: {
                __default__: [[2, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0]],
                subj_08: [[2, 2, 0], [1, 1, 3], [0, 0, 0]],
                }

1. fetch_raw
------------

Fetch raw files from an acquisition machine.

``fetch_raw``: Raw fetching parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
subjects : list of str
    Subject names.
structurals : list of str
    List of subject structurals.
dates : list of tuple or None
    Dates to use for anonymization. Use "None" to more fully anonymize.
acq_ssh : str
    The acquisition machine SSH name.
acq_dir : list of str
    List of paths to search and fetch raw data.
acq_port : int
    Acquisition port.
acq_exclude : list of str
    Regular expressions to exclude when trying to find the correct remote
    directory. This can be useful for example if a subject was run more than
    once, or someone has done some preprocessing or made copies on the
    acquisition machine, e.g.::

        ['genz_proc', 'genz_[0-9]+_[0-9]+a']

    which means "exclude anything with 'genz_proc'; or anything with a
    substring that has 'genz\_', followed by at least one number, followed by
    '_', followed by at least one number, followed by 'a'" -- the latter being
    useful when subjects should be named ``genz100_9a`` but have some duplicate
    directories named ``genz_100_9a``.
run_names : list of str
    Run names for the paradigm.
runs_empty : list of str
    Empty room run names.
subject_run_indices : list of array-like | dict | None
    Run indices to include for each subject. This can be a list
    (must be same length as ``params.subjects``) or a dict (keys are subject
    strings, values are the run indices) where missing subjects get all runs.
    None is an alias for "all runs".

2. do_score
-----------

Do the scoring. This converts TTL triggers to meaningful events.

``scoring``: Scoring parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
score : callable | None
    Scoring function used to slice data into trials.
on_process : callable
    Called at each processing step.

.. _do_sss:

3. do_sss
---------

.. warning:: Before running SSS, set ``params.mf_prebad[SUBJ]`` to a
             list of bad MEG channels (str), or (old way) create
             `SUBJ/raw_fif/SUBJ_prebad.txt`` with space-separated list of bad
             MEG channel numbers (int).
             Using ``p.mf_autobad=True`` can help fill in missed bad channels,
             but is not as reliable as experienced analyst inspection.

Run SSS processing. This will:

1. Copy each raw file to the SSS workstation.
2. Automatically determine bad channels (only if ``mf_autobad=True``)
3. Estimate head positions (remotely if ``hp_type='maxwell'``, otherwise
   locally), see :ref:`preprocessing_hpe`.
4. Copy the head positions to the local machine.
5. Delete generated files from the remote machine.
6. Annotate bad segments automatically, see :ref:`preprocessing_annotations`.
7. Add any custom annotations (e.g., for segments that operators want to
   manually mark as bad) that have been saved as ``FILENAME-custom-annot.fif``.
8. Run SSS processing locally using :func:`mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`.

The addition of annotations *before* SSS ensures that tSSS operations are not
disrupted by bad segments of data, and also ensures that the output files
have the annotations (as they are preserved by ``mnefun``).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
n_jobs : int
    Number of jobs to use in parallel operations.
n_jobs_mkl : int
    Number of jobs to spawn in parallel for operations that can make
    use of MKL threading. If Numpy/Scipy has been compiled with MKL
    support, it is best to leave this at 1 or 2 since MKL will
    automatically spawn threads. Otherwise, n_cpu is a good choice.
n_jobs_fir : int | str
    Number of threads to use for FIR filtering. Can also be 'cuda'
    if the system supports CUDA.
n_jobs_resample : int | str

st_correlation : float
    Correlation limit between inner and outer subspaces used to reject
    ovwrlapping intersecting inner/outer signals during spatiotemporal SSS.

5. gen_ssp
----------

.. warning:: Before running SSP, examine SSS'ed files and make
             ``SUBJ/bads/bad_ch_SUBJ_post-sss.txt``; usually, this should only
             contain EEG channels. Alternatively, you can use
             ``params.auto_bad = some_float``, see
             :ref:`preprocessing_auto_bads`.

Generate SSP vectors. If additional projectors are required (e.g., to get
rid of muscle movement artifacts in a verbal response paradigm), you can use
``p.proj_extra``, which get applied before any other projectors are computed
(e.g., ECG, blink).

``preprocessing: filtering``: Filtering parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hp_cut : float | None
    Highpass cutoff in Hz. Use None for no highpassing.
hp_trans : float
    High-pass transition band.

    See :func:`mne.filter.create_filter`.

.. _preprocessing_auto_bads:

``preprocessing: post-SSS bads``: Marking bad channels during SSP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
auto_bad : float | None
    If not None, bad channels will be automatically excluded after SSS if
    they disqualify a proportion of events exceeding ``auto_bad``.
    This does not require the autoreject module.
auto_bad_reject : str | dict | None
    Default is None. Must be defined if using Autoreject module to
    compute noisy sensor rejection criteria. Set to 'auto' to compute
    criteria automatically, or dictionary of channel keys and amplitude
    values e.g., dict(grad=1500e-13, mag=5000e-15, eeg=150e-6) to define
    rejection threshold(s). See
    http://autoreject.github.io/ for details.
auto_bad_flat : dict | None
    Flat threshold for auto bad.
auto_bad_eeg_thresh : int | None
    If more than this number of EEG channels is automatically marked bad,
    an error will be raised. This helps ensure that not too many channels
    are marked as bad.
auto_bad_meg_thresh : int | None
    Same as above but for MEG.

``preprocessing: ssp``: SSP creation parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
proj_nums : list | dict
    List of projector counts to use for ECG/blink/ERM/HEOG/VEOG; each list
    contains three values for grad/mag/eeg channels.
    Can be a dict that maps subject names to projector counts to use.
    The order of computation and application is empty-room, ECG, blink,
    HEOG, VEOG.

    ECG, blink, and ERM are obligatory lists (though they can be lists of all
    zeros). Lists for HEOG and VEOG are optional. For example,
    if you want 1 blink, 2 HEOG, and 3 VEOG projectors (for a total of 6
    EOG-related projectors) for each channel type, you would do::

        [[...],
         [1, 1, 1],
         [...],
         [2, 2, 2],
         [3, 3, 3]]

    If you want just blink and HEOG, you can use a list of 4 lists instead of
    5 (or 3).
proj_sfreq : float | None
    The sample freq to use for calculating projectors. Useful since
    time points are not independent following low-pass. Also saves
    computation to downsample.
proj_meg : str
    Can be "separate" (default for backward compat) or "combined"
    (should be better for SSS'ed data).

    The percentage threshold to use when deciding whether or not to
    plot Epochs drop_log.
plot_raw : bool
    If True, plot the raw files with the ECG/EOG events overlaid.

    In lieu of an EOG recording, MEG1411 may work.
veog_channel : str | dict | None
    The channel to use to detect HEOG events. None will use EOG062.
ecg_channel : str | dict | None
    The channel to use to detect ECG events. None will use ECG063.
    In lieu of an ECG recording, MEG1531 may work.
    Can be a dict that maps subject names to channels.
eog_t_lims : tuple | dict
    The time limits for EOG calculation. Default (-0.25, 0.25).
heog_t_lims : tuple | dict
    The time limits for HEOG calculation. Default (-0.25, 0.25).
veog_t_lims : tuple | dict
    The time limits for VEOG calculation. Default (-0.25, 0.25).
ecg_t_lims : tuple | dict
    The time limits for ECG calculation. Default(-0.08, 0.08).
eog_f_lims : tuple | dict
    Band-pass limits for EOG detection and calculation. Default (0, 2).

    Band-pass limits for VEOG detection and calculation. Default (0, 2).
ecg_f_lims : tuple | dict
    Band-pass limits for ECG detection and calculation. Default (5, 35).
eog_thresh : float | dict | None
    Threshold for EOG detection. Can vary per subject.
heog_thresh : float | dict | None
    Threshold for HEOG detection. Can vary per subject.

    Threshold for VEOG detection. Can vary per subject.
proj_ave : bool
    If True, average artifact epochs before computing proj.
proj_extra : str | None
    Extra projector filename to load for each subject, e.g.
    ``extra-proj.fif`` will load ``SUBJ/sss_pca_fif/extra-proj.fif``.
get_projs_from : list of int | dict
    Indices for runs to get projects from.
cont_hp : float
    Highpass to use for continuous ERM projectors (default None).
cont_hp_trans : float | None
    Highpass transition bandwidth to use for continuous ERM projectors
    (default 0.5).

cont_lp_trans : float | None
    Lowpass transition bandwidth for continuous ERM projectors (default None).
cont_reject : dict | None
    Rejection parameters for continuous empty-room projection calculations.
    None (default) will use ``params.reject``.
    This likely needs to be set when ``cont_as_esss=True``.

    Adjustment for delays (e.g., -4e-3 compensates for a 4 ms delay
    in the trigger.
baseline : tuple | None | str
    Baseline to use. If "individual", use ``params.bmin`` and
    ``params.bmax``, otherwise pass as the baseline parameter to
    mne-python Epochs. ``params.bmin`` and ``params.bmax`` will always
    be used for covariance calculation. This is useful e.g. when using
    a high-pass filter and no baselining is desired (but evoked
    covariances should still be calculated from the baseline period).
bmin : float
    Lower limit for baseline compensation.
bmax : float
    Upper limit for baseline compensation.
decim : int | float | list
    Amount to decimate the data after filtering when epoching data
    (e.g., a factor of 5 on 1000 Hz data yields 200 Hz data).
    If a float is used, it should be the destination sample rate
    (e.g., a value of 200. with 1000 Hz data will use  decim=5).
epochs_type : str | list
    Can be 'fif', 'mat', or a list containing both.
match_fun : callable | None
    If None, standard matching will be performed. If a function,
    must_match will be ignored, and ``match_fun`` will be called
    to equalize event counts.
reject : dict
    Rejection parameters for epochs.
flat : dict
    Flat thresholds for epoch rejection.
reject_tmin : float | None
    Reject minimum time to use when epoching. None will use ``tmin``.

    Reject maximum time to use when epoching. None will use ``tmax``.
on_missing : string
    Can set to ‘error’ | ‘warning’ | ‘ignore’. Default is 'error'.
    Determine what to do if one or several event ids are not found in the
    recording during epoching. See mne.Epochs docstring for further
    details.
autoreject_thresholds : bool | False
    If True use autoreject module to compute global rejection thresholds
    for epoching. Make sure autoreject module is installed. See
    http://autoreject.github.io/ for instructions.
autoreject_types : tuple
    Default is ('mag', 'grad', 'eeg'). Can set to ('mag', 'grad', 'eeg',
    'eog) to use EOG channel rejection criterion from autoreject module to
    reject trials on basis of EOG.
reject_epochs_by_annot : bool
    If True, reject epochs by BAD annotations.
pick_events_autoreject : callable | string | None
    Function for picking autoreject events, or the string "restrict"
    to limit events to those with an id in ``in_numbers``.
analyses : list of str
    Lists of analyses of interest.

    Names of input events.
in_numbers : list of list of int
    Event numbers (in scored event files) associated with each name.
out_names : list of list of str
    Event types to make out of old ones.
out_numbers : list of list of int
    Event numbers to convert to (e.g., [[1, 1, 2, 3, 3], ...] would create
    three event types, where the first two and last two event types from
    the original list get collapsed over).
must_match : list of int
    Indices from the original in_names that must match in event counts
    before collapsing. Should eventually be expanded to allow for
    ratio-based collapsing.
every_other : bool
    If True, in addition to standard averages / evoked data, averages will be
    computed from every other trial, i.e., from even and odd trials separately.
    This can help assess the SNR of the data.
epochs_proj : bool | 'delayed'
    The ``proj`` argument in :class:`mne.Epochs`. Should be ``'delayed'`` if
    you want the option of plotting sensor-space data with no projectors.

8. gen_covs
-----------
Generate covariances.

``covariance``: Covariance parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cov_method : str
    Covariance calculation method.
compute_rank : bool
    Default is False. Set to True to compute rank of the noise covariance
    matrix during inverse kernel computation.
pick_events_cov : callable | string | None
    Function for picking covariance events, or the string "restrict"
    to limit events to those with an id in ``in_numbers``.
cov_rank : str | int
    Cov rank to use, usually "auto".
cov_rank_method : str
    Can be "estimate_rank" to use ``mne.rank.estimate_rank``, or
    "compute_rank" to use :func:`mne.compute_rank`. The latter seems to
    work better for custom ``tol`` values by not row-normalizing data.
cov_rank_tol : float | str
    Tolerance for covariance rank computation. Can also be
    "auto" or "float32", though these tend not to be very robust.
force_erm_cov_rank_full : bool
    If True, force the ERM cov to be full rank.
    Usually not needed, but might help when the empty-room data
    is short and/or there are a lot of head movements.


9. gen_fwd
----------
.. warning:: Make SUBJ/trans/SUBJ-trans.fif using :ref:`mne:mne coreg`.

Generate forward solutions (and source space if necessary).

preload : bool
    If True (default False), load all raw data into memory before generating
    plots. Can help speed up computations like PSD estimates, but can also
    consume a large amount of memory.


Filename standardization
------------------------
mnefun imposes custom standardized structure on filenames:

``naming``: File naming tags and folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
list_dir : str
    Directory for event lists, usually "lists".
bad_dir : str
    Directory to use for bad channels, usually "bads".
bad_tag : str
    Tag for bid channel filename, usually "_post-sss.txt".
raw_dir : str
    Raw directory, usually "raw_fif".
keep_orig : bool
    Keep original files after anonymization.
raw_fif_tag : str
    File tag for raw data, usually "_raw.fif".
sss_fif_tag : str
    File tag for SSS-processed files, usually "_raw_sss.fif".
sss_dir : str
    Directory to use for SSS processed files, usually "sss_fif".
pca_dir : str
    Directory for processed files, usually "sss_pca_fif".
epochs_dir : str
    Directory for epochs, usually "epochs".
epochs_prefix : str
    The prefix to use for the ``-epo.fif`` file.
epochs_tag : str
    Tag for epoochs, usually '-epo'.
eq_tag : str
    Tag for equalized data, usually "eq".
cov_dir : str
    Directory to use for covariances, usually "covariance".
forward_dir : str
    Directory for forward solutions, usually "forward".
trans_dir : str
    Directory to use for trans files, usually "trans".
inverse_dir : str
    Directory for storing inverses, usually "inverse".
inv_tag : str
    Tag for all inverses, usually "-sss".
inv_erm_tag : str
    Tag for ERM inverse, usually "-erm".
inv_fixed_tag : str
    Tag for fixed inverse, usually "-fixed".
inv_loose_tag : str
    Tag for loose inverse, usually "".
inv_free_tag : str
    Tag for free orientation inverse, usually "-free".

Preparing your machine for MaxFilter use
----------------------------------------
.. warning:: Head position estimation and bad channel detection are now
             available using ``hp_type='python'`` and
             ``mf_autobad_type='python``, respectively.
             These are the preferred processing methods going forward
             (as of March 2020), and using MaxFilter should be considered
             deprecated.

Parameters for remotely connecting to SSS workstation ('sws') can be set
by adding a file `~/.mnefun/mnefun.json` with contents like:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir ~/.mnefun
    $ echo '{"sws_ssh":"kasga", "sws_dir":"/data06/larsoner/sss_work", "sws_port":22}' > ~/.mnefun/mnefun.json

This should be preferred to the old way, which was to set in each script
when running on your machine::

    params.sws_ssh = 'kasga'
    params.sws_dir = '/data06/larsoner/sss_work'

Using per-machine config files rather than per-script variables should
help increase portability of scripts without hurting reproducibility
(assuming we all use the same version of MaxFilter, which should be a
safe assumption).

To test that things are configured correctly, you can do:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -c "import mnefun; mnefun.check_sws()"
    On kasga: maxfilter -version (0 sec)
    Output:
    Revision: 2.2.15 Neuromag maxfilter Dec 11 2012 14:48:44

If you get an error:

1. Ensure that your file is correctly set up in ``~/.mnefun/mnefun.json``.
   It needs to use standard quotation marks like ``"``, not fancy ones like
   ``”`` so ensure that your text editor (if you used one) did not use fancy
   quotation marks.
2. Ensure that ``maxwell_filter`` is accessible as a command on the remote
   machine. Log into the remote machine and do:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ which maxfilter
       /neuro/bin/util/maxfilter

   If you get no output with this command, it means that MaxFilter is not
   available on your PATH on the remote machine. To fix this, consider adding
   the following line to the end of your ``~/.bashrc`` on the remote machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

       export PATH=${PATH}:/neuro/bin/util:/neuro/bin/X11
