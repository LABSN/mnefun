----------------------------------
Example experiment analysis script
----------------------------------

This sample script shows how to preprocess a simple MEG experiment
from start to finish.

The experiment was a simple audio/visual oddball detection task. One
potential purpose would be e.g. functional localization of auditory and
visual cortices.

Note that you will need to change the "acq_ssh" and "sss_ssh" parameters
to reflect your username/password on the relevant machines. You will also
need to set up public key authentication between your machine and the
two remote machines (acquisition/minea and SSS/kasga). Tutorial here:

    * https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys

The deidentified structural directories for the one subject is needed
to do the forward and inverse solutions, extract this into your
SUBJECTS_DIR directory:
